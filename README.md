# ⚙️ Real-Time EC Task Scheduler Simulator  
_A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Embedded Scheduling Algorithms_

This repository contains a flexible simulation environment for analyzing real-time task scheduling strategies in embedded electronics applications. It supports multiple scheduling policies, performance benchmarking, and an interactive GUI for visualization and control. Designed for academic research, system prototyping, and educational use.

---

## 📖 Overview

The simulator enables evaluation of key scheduling algorithms used in embedded systems, including:

- **Round Robin**  
- **Priority-Based Scheduling**  
- **FreeRTOS-Compatible Scheduling**

It provides both graphical and programmable interfaces, allowing users to visualize task execution, monitor performance metrics, and export results for further analysis.
